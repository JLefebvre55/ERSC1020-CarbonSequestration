# ERSC1020-CarbonSequestration
Seminar Task 1: Carbon sequestration, tree planting, and climate change.

In your seminars on climate change, you discussed the pros and cons and difficulties with tree planting as a carbon-reduction strategy and how the increased number of forest fires may counter this. In your discussions you also became aware of different points of view from different “stakeholders” with perhaps differing economic and social views on the topic. You also saw how one paper can impact policy.

- Provide a summary of the seminar discussions.
- Relate the issues surrounding tree planting to one or more of the course themes (see first class slides).
- What policies and direction should we take? What are the stumbling blocks to moving
forward?

## Requirements

- 1000 – 1200 words (this is approximately 3 – 4 pages excluding references and diagrams)
- 12-point font; 1.5 line spacing (so we can easily add comments/feedback)
- Note: if you can write what you need to say in less than 1200 words – great! We value content over length. 
- Connect 3-5 course themes

## Rubric

- Is there an accurate summary of the issue of tree planting and the impact of forest fires? Make sure to focus on the topics discussed in your seminars – the major questions raised, the pros and cons, the sticking points, etc. Are one or more course themes brought into the discussion. Did you go beyond the obvious? Seminar discussion summary, course themes-topic connections, & future direction/challenges: all present & accurate, connecting on all key points and relevant minor ones, clear idea with convincing detail,. E.g., connecting well to 3-5 course themes, showing interconnectedness. (80%)
- Is the writing easy to understand and well organized? Is your essay free of typos and grammatical mistakes? Is the writing concise? Delight to read. Powerful word choice. Excellent sentence and paragraph fluency. Organization seamless, unified, coherent. (5%)
- Are there references showing further research for a deeper understanding of the issue? Use proper referencing technique (APA format) to recognize works and websites that support your work. There is no minimum number of references required. At the very least, you will be referencing the articles we suggested. Referencing present with all high quality references, using a complete, consistent and correct citation style. (5%)
